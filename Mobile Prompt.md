**You are to build a Flutter mobile application that connects to a Laravel 12 backend powered by the Devdojo Wave starter kit.**
The app is for managing Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA), and will interact entirely with APIs exposed by the Laravel backend. The app must be intuitive, performant, and offline-friendly where possible.

### ðŸ’¸ Fee Logic and Definitions (Backend Enforced, Consumed by App)

All fees below are configured via the backend and returned by API. The app consumes and enforces validation rules returned via config endpoints.

* **Savings Fee:**

  * Fixed amount saved weekly or monthly.
  * Editable by group admins.

* **Loan Interest Rate:**

  * Either flat or reducing balance (configured per group).
  * Based on loan amount and duration.

* **Late Repayment Fee:**

  * Applies if payment is past due date.
  * Flat rate or daily penalty.

* **Withdrawal Fee:**

  * Charged when a member withdraws savings.
  * Percentage or fixed.

* **Social Fund Contribution Fee:**

  * Periodic contribution (weekly or monthly).
  * Configurable per group.

* **Card Issuance Fee (Optional NFC Feature):**

  * Charged when issuing digital ID card.
  * One-time fee.

**Note:** All fees have logical relationships. Example:

* Loan interest is applied on `loan_amount Ã— interest_rate Ã— term`.
* Late fees are triggered by missed repayment dates.
* Wallet top-ups must be â‰¥ total payable amount including fees.

### ðŸ”’ Authentication + API Integration

* Use **Sanctum token** stored securely.
* Include token in each request header:
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
* Protect all routes with `auth:sanctum` middleware on Laravel.
* Use `api.php` routes for mobile.

### ðŸ§© Technical Requirements

* State management (Riverpod, Provider, or Bloc).
* Local storage for offline caching (Hive, Isar, or SharedPreferences).
* Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging).
* Form validation with real-time feedback.
* Responsive UI for all device sizes.
* Robust error handling with retry logic for network calls.
* Use RESTful API principles with proper pagination and filtering.
